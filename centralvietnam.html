      <h2>Da Nang: A Coastal Gem in Central Vietnam</h2>
      <p>Located along the South China Sea in central Vietnam, Da Nang has emerged as a top travel 
        destination for international visitors. With its wide range of attractions and activities, 
        the city offers countless opportunities to create unforgettable memories. From breathtaking 
        natural scenery to rich cultural experiences, Da Nang promises a journey full of excitement 
        and discovery. This guide provides essential information to help you explore everything the 
        city has to offer.</p>
      
        <p> Geographically, Da Nang lies between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City—764 kilometers south of Hanoi and 964 
        kilometers north of Ho Chi Minh City. It borders Thua Thien Hue Province to the north, with Hue City just 
        108 kilometers away. To the west and south, it shares boundaries with Quang Nam Province, while the eastern 
        side faces the vast South China Sea.</p>

        One of Da Nang&#39;s most famous landmarks, the Marble Mountains consist of six limestone peaks: Kim Son, 
        Moc Son, Thuy Son, Tho Son, Duong Hoa Son, and Am Hoa Son. Covering nearly 2 square kilometers, this site 
        holds both natural beauty and cultural significance. Recognized as a national relic in 1980 and upgraded 
        to a special national site in 2019, it hosts the annual Quan The Am Festival, which celebrates Vietnamese 
        spirituality and tradition.</p>

      <h2>Hue: Vietnam&#39; Historic Capital</h2>
      <p>Hue is widely recognized as Vietnam&#39;s former imperial capital, a title it held from 1801 until 1945. Although it may not be as ancient as 
        some might assume, Hue played a crucial role in shaping the country&#39;s cultural identity during the reign of the Nguyen dynasty. 
        Interestingly, this dynasty is also responsible for the widespread use of the surname “Nguyen,” which is now shared by approximately 
        39% of the Vietnamese population.</p>

      <p>Stroll Along the “Golden Mile” Situated just south of the Perfume River, the “Golden Mile” refers to the stretch of Le Loi Street between 
        Ha Noi Street and Chu Van An. It is considered one of the most pleasant areas for walking, especially for first-time visitors. 
        The nearby streets—Doi Cung, Pham Ngu Lao, and Vo Thi Sau—are equally charming and are closed to traffic on weekend evenings. 
        This allows pedestrians to enjoy traditional performances and street food in a relaxed, car-free environment. An evening walk along 
        the Golden Mile offers a wonderful opportunity to experience the vibrant atmosphere of modern Hue.</p>

      <p>Nha Trang is a lively seaside town renowned for its abundant sunshine—boasting more sunny days annually 
        than any other location in Vietnam. Its main attraction, Tran Phu Beach, stretches for seven kilometers 
        along the coast, offering soft white sand, crystal-clear waters, swaying palm trees, and vibrant beachside 
        bars and seafood eateries.</p>

      <p>One of the city&#39;s most captivating features is its stunning bay, dotted with 19 islands and islets. 
        Tran Phu Beach is a hub of activity, where visitors relax on sun loungers and enjoy a wide range of water 
        sports, including parasailing, kite surfing, paddle boarding, and jet skiing. For a quieter experience, 
        travelers can take a motorbike ride to Long Beach, located just outside the city. This peaceful spot 
        features shallow turquoise waters and local restaurants serving freshly caught seafood. For a scenic 
        day trip, head 60 kilometers north to Doc Let Beach, considered one of the most picturesque coastal areas in Vietnam.</p>

      <p>No visit to Nha Trang is complete without experiencing its famous mud baths. The mineral-rich clay is believed to offer therapeutic 
        benefits, such as improved circulation and skin hydration. After soaking in the warm, sticky mud, visitors can rinse off under cool 
        waterfalls and unwind in hot mineral pools. For those seeking extra indulgence, treatments like coffee massages and chocolate 
        body wraps are available. Among the three mud bath facilities in the city, I-Resort is the most popular. It also features a large 
        water park with slides, pools, and exciting water activities—making it a perfect destination for families and groups.</p>

      <h2>Phu Yen: Vietnam&#39;s Hidden Gem on the Central Coast</h2>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="img/phu_yen_1.jpg" alt="Phu Quoc" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
      </figure>

      <p>Phu Yen is a province located in central Vietnam, bordered by a dramatic mountain range to the west and over 200 kilometers of coastline 
        to the east. Traditionally an agricultural region, Phu Yen has only recently begun to attract attention as a tourist destination. 
        Its rise in popularity is largely credited to the 2015 Vietnamese film Toi Thay Hoa Vang Tren Co Xanh (Dear Brother), which showcased 
        the province&#39;s natural beauty.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">

        <figcaption>Tuy Hoa City and Beach</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Tuy Hoa, the provincial capital, is situated roughly halfway between the well-known beach cities of Nha Trang and Quy Nhon. Its strategic 
        location makes it an ideal stop for travelers journeying along Vietnam&#39;s central coast. Despite its accessibility, Tuy Hoa remains 
        relatively untouched by mass tourism, offering a peaceful atmosphere. The city is thoughtfully designed, with wide, well-maintained streets 
        forming a neat grid along the river. Tuy Hoa Beach runs along the eastern edge of the city, featuring a scenic promenade and a tranquil shoreline.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">

      <p>Bai Mon is a secluded beach nestled between rugged mountains. For a truly memorable experience, visitors are encouraged to arrive at dawn and 
        hike up the winding path to Mui Dien Lighthouse. From this vantage point—Vietnam&#39;s second easternmost tip—the sunrise over the ocean is 
        breathtaking. A second staircase leads down to Bai Mon Beach, which feels like a hidden paradise surrounded by cliffs and greenery.</p>

      </figure> 

      <p>While Bai Xep is perhaps the most well-known destination in Phu Yen, Da Dia Reef stands out as its most extraordinary natural wonder. 
        Formed by volcanic activity, the reef features striking hexagonal basalt columns that resemble a giant honeycomb. These geometric formations 
        cascade into the sea, creating a surreal landscape reminiscent of a video game. Nearby, a beach offers refreshments and a walking path 
        that leads to another lighthouse, providing panoramic views of the ocean and the unique rock formations.</p>

      <h2>Quy Nhon: A Coastal Treasure in Central Vietnam</h2>
      <p>Nestled along Vietnam&#39;s central coastline, Quy Nhon enjoys a stunning natural setting, framed by pristine beaches and verdant mountains. 
        Its location makes it an ideal destination for travelers seeking both relaxation and cultural exploration.
        The climate in Quy Nhon is a blend of northern and southern Vietnam&#39;s weather patterns, characterized by a tropical, semi-humid atmosphere. 
        From January to August, the city experiences hot and dry conditions, with temperatures often reaching the mid-30s Celsius, particularly from May 
        onward. As autumn approaches, temperatures begin to cool. Rainfall increases during the winter months, peaking in October and November. 
        Although typhoons occasionally bring strong winds and heavy rain, flooding is rarely reported.</p>

      <p>Located on the Phuong Mai Peninsula, approximately 25 kilometers northeast of Quy Nhon, Ky Co Beach is a tropical paradise. Its powdery sands and 
        turquoise waters create a serene environment perfect for swimming, snorkeling, or simply relaxing amidst the surrounding cliffs and greenery.
        Nearby, Eo Gio—meaning “Windy Strait”—offers dramatic coastal scenery and refreshing sea breezes. Towering cliffs plunge into the ocean, 
        forming a breathtaking landscape that captivates visitors.</p>
