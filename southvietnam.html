      <h2>Ho Chi Minh City: Discover Urban Life and Cultural Heritage</h2>
      <p> Ho Chi Minh City, once known as Saigon before 1975, is the economic and cultural 
      heart of Southern Vietnam. It blends modern development with deep historical roots. 
      The city's role in Vietnam&#39;s wartime past is preserved at sites like the War Remnants 
      Museum and the Cu Chi Tunnels. Visitors can also admire French colonial architecture 
      at landmarks such as the Notre Dame Cathedral and the Central Post Office.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="img/nha-tho-duc-ba.png" alt="Notre Dame Cathedral" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">
        <figcaption>Notre Dame Cathedral. Source: XanhSM</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>A good starting point for exploring the city is Ben Thanh Market, located in 
        District 1. This area is known for its lively atmosphere, offering local cuisine, 
        shopping, and vibrant nightlife, especially at rooftop bars. Nguyen Hue Walking Street 
        is another highlight, often bustling with activity during festivals and public events.
        For a deeper cultural experience, travelers can visit Cho Lon, also known as Saigon&#39;s Chinatown. 
        This district reflects the influence of Chinese immigrants who settled there from the 16th to the 
        20th century. Temples like Thien Hau and Quan De showcase traditional Chinese architecture and 
        spiritual practices, offering insight into the area's rich cultural blend.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">

      <p>Duoc and Ben Dinh. Ben Dinh, located about 12 km southeast of the city, is less crowded but equally interesting. 
        Entry costs around 35,000 VND for locals and 70,000 VND for foreigners, though guided tours often include the fee.
        The tour begins with a short presentation in a hut built below ground, showing maps, videos, and wartime items. 
        Visitors then walk through the jungle, passing old military equipment like artillery and bomb shells. Guides 
        demonstrate hidden tunnel entrances camouflaged with leaves, and guests can try fitting into one.
        When entering the tunnels, it&#39;s best to leave your bag behind. The first section is only 20 meters long with an early exit, 
        while the second stretches 70 meters. The tunnels have been widened for safety, but staying close to the guide helps avoid 
        discomfort in the narrow space.</p>

      <h2>Vung Tau: A Relaxing Coastal Escape</h2>
      <p>The pretty seaside town of Vung Tau is the Vietnamese equivalent of fish and chips and a few days by the sea. 
        In short, it's where locals go to relax, soak up the sea breeze, and indulge in seafood feasts. 
        Vung Tau may not have Con Dao's paradisiacal white-sand beaches, but just two hours from Ho Chi Minh City, 
        it's perfect for a quick getaway. Here is the perfect guide to your Vung Tau holiday.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">

      <p>Dip your toes in cool water and watch the day wake up on Vung Tau&#39;s beautiful Back Beach. 
        This three kilometer-long strip of sand will entice you to spend a day in the shade of an umbrella, cocktail in hand. 
        A handful of high-end hotels, restaurants, and beach clubs line Back Beach, and local vendors rent umbrellas on the sand. 
        When you are hungry, break for a delicious seafood lunch overlooking the water. </p>

      <p>Vung Tau&#39;s famous Jesus Christ statue was built in 1974, and stands at 32 metres tall. You will
         need to cover about 800 steps up the headland to reach the feet of the statue, plus another 100 steps 
         to its shoulders. Prepare for a steep climb, as well as amazing views from the top.</p>

        known for their natural beauty and wildlife. As part of Ba Ria, Vung Tau Province and now belongs to Ho Chi 
        Minh province, the islands are home to Vietnam&#39;s largest sea turtle conservation area. From September to 
        November, visitors can witness turtles laying eggs and baby turtles heading to the sea, especially on Bay 
        Canh Island.</p>

      <h2>The Mekong Delta: A Rich Blend of Nature and Culture</h2>
      <p>When planning a trip to Vietnam, the Mekong Delta is a must-visit destination, known for its stunning landscapes and deep cultural roots. Tourists can explore traditional 
        villages, visit bustling floating markets, and enjoy authentic local dishes at affordable prices. This region offers a unique glimpse into rural Vietnamese life. </p>

      <p>Geographically, the Mekong Delta is a flat area shaped by sediment from rivers and changes in sea level. Its fertile soil, enriched by alluvial deposits, makes it ideal 
        for agriculture—especially rice farming. The average elevation ranges from 0.5 to 1.2 meters above sea level, and the region is often affected by seasonal flooding.
        The climate here is tropical, with high humidity year-round. There are two main seasons: the wet season from May to October, and the dry season from November to April. During 
        the rainy months, storms and typhoons can cause significant damage. The landscape is dominated by lush green rice fields, and waterways play a central role in daily life. 
        Boats, floating houses, and markets are common sights along the rivers and canals.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">

      </figure>

      <p>Culturally, the Mekong Delta is vibrant and diverse. Its cuisine reflects influences from Cambodian and Thai cooking, featuring freshwater fish, tropical fruits, and vegetables. 
        A key ingredient in many dishes is fermented fish sauce, which adds a rich, savory flavor. The food here is not only delicious but also deeply connected to the region&#39;s traditions and way of life.</p>

      <h2>Floating Markets: The Charm of River Life in Vietnam</h2>
      <p>No one knows exactly when floating markets first appeared, but they have long been a vibrant part of life in Vietnam&#39;s river regions. These markets bring together hundreds of boats of all sizes from different areas, 
        creating a unique water-based economy and community.</p>

      <figure style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="img/cho-noi.jpg" alt="Phu Quoc" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">

        <figcaption>Floating Market in Hau Giang</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>What makes floating markets so special is that all trading activities take place on boats. In the past, people used traditional wooden boats like the xuồng ba lá or ghe tam bản, but today, motorized boats such as tắc 
        ráng are also common. Buyers and tourists arrive by boat, weaving skillfully through the crowded waterways without collisions. The market usually starts early, around 3 or 4 a.m., and winds down by mid-morning. However, 
        the most lively and colorful time to visit is during the Lunar New Year. The river becomes even more vibrant with blooming flowers and festive fruits. During this season, the cheerful sounds of traditional music and s
        pring songs echo from the boats, creating a joyful atmosphere and expressing hopes for a prosperous new year.</p>
