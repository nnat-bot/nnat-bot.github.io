      <h2>Ha Noi: Vietnam's Capital</h2>
      <p>LHanoi, Vietnam&#39;s capital, has a history that stretches back over a thousand years. Its Old Quarter, 
        with narrow streets dating to the 14th century, offers a glimpse into the past. Walking through these 
        tree-shaded lanes, past old colonial buildings, feels like stepping back in time. But Hanoi isn&#39;t 
        just about history—it&#39;s also a vibrant modern city. Today, you&#39;ll find stylish cafés, top-rated 
        restaurants, and contemporary art galleries. At night, the city comes alive with rooftop bars and lively 
        bia hơi spots. If you&#39;re visiting Hanoi for the first time, there are some must-try experiences that 
        truly capture the spirit of the city.</p>

      <p><strong>The Legend of Hoan Kiem Lake: A Tale of the Magical Sword</strong></p>
      <p>According to legend, in the 15th century, Vietnam was suffering under the control and exploitation of northern 
        invaders. Seeing the country&#39;s hardship, the Sea God gave a magical sword to King Le, helping him defeat 
        the enemy and bring peace to the land. Later, while the king was sailing on a lake, a giant turtle suddenly appeared 
        and asked him to return the sword to the Sea God. The king respectfully gave the sword back, and the turtle disappeared 
        beneath the water. From that moment on, the lake—originally called Luc Thuy Lake—was renamed Hoan Kiem Lake, 
        meaning “Lake of the Returned Sword.” To this day, the story remains a mystery, especially with the presence of turtles 
        in the lake, which continue to spark curiosity and wonder among locals and visitors alike.</p>

      <p><strong>Explore the Old Quarter</strong></p>
      <p>Located just north and slightly west of Hoàn Kiếm Lake, Hanoi&#39;s Old Quarter is made up of 36 streets, 
        each known for selling specific items. It&#39;s a great place to walk around and observe the chaotic charm of 
        motorbikes carrying all sorts of goods. Some of the most famous streets include:
        <ul>
          <li>Hang Dau: known for shoes</li>
          <li>Hang Ma: famous for lanterns</li>
          <li>Hang Bac: silver jewelry</li>
          <li>Hang Vai: bamboo products</li>
          <li>Hang Duong: sweets and sugar</li>
          <li>Lan Ong: traditional medicine</li>
          <li>Hang Gai: silk products</li>

      </figure>

      <p><strong>Visit Hanoi&#39;s Train Street</strong></p>
      <p>There are two locations in Hanoi where trains pass extremely close to cafés. The most popular one is just south of the 
        Old Quarter, near Thống Nhất Park. I visited a café called Hanoi 1990s, which I booked in advance via WhatsApp. 
        Although many people just walk in, I preferred to reserve ahead. The entrance is easy to find—just go to Ngõ 
        222 Đ. Lê Duẩn, which crosses the tracks near the café. When the train comes, the staff quickly clears the tables, 
        and guests are asked to sit close to the wall for safety. It&#39;s a thrilling experience. Drinks cost around 60,000 VND, 
        and if you don&#39;t order anything, there&#39;s a minimum charge of 40,000 VND to sit.</p>

      </figure>

      <p><strong>Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Surroundings</strong></p>
      <p>Behind the Ho Chi Minh Museum is a large green area with several attractions related to the former leader. The most 
        famous is the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, where visitors can view his preserved body. The building is especially beautiful 
        when lit up at night. Nearby, you&#39;ll find Ho Chi Minh&#39;s Stilt House and the One Pillar Pagoda, a wooden structure 
        built on a single concrete pillar shaped like a lotus flower. Originally built in 1054, it was destroyed by the French 
        in 1954 and later rebuilt.</p>

      <p><strong>Vietnam Museum of Ethnology</strong></p>
      <p>This museum explores the 54 ethnic groups that make up Vietnam. One of the highlights is the outdoor area, which features full-scale 
        traditional houses. The most impressive is the Bahnar communal house, which stands 19 meters tall and was my personal favorite.</p>

      <p><strong>St. Joseph Cathedral</strong></p>
      <p>Constructed in 1886, this neo-Gothic cathedral is a striking reminder of the colonial era. Its tall bell towers are a key feature. 
        The main entrance is only open during mass, but visitors can enter through the side door at other times. The street beside the 
        cathedral is lined with charming cafés, including the taproom of Pasteur Street Brewing, my favorite Vietnamese craft beer brand.</p>

      <h2>Discover Ninh Binh: A Day of Nature and History</h2>
      <p>Just two hours south of Hanoi, Ninh Binh stands out as one of Vietnam&#39;s most stunning destinations. With peaceful boat rides

      <p><strong>Start at Hoa Lư Ancient Capital</strong></p>
      <p>Begin your journey at Hoa Lư, the former capital of Vietnam&#39;s first feudal dynasty. This historic site witnessed dramatic 
        events, including royal reigns, political intrigue, and the eventual move of the capital to Hanoi after 42 years. 
        Surrounded by limestone mountains and natural moats, Hoa Lư offers a peaceful yet powerful atmosphere. Take time to explore its 
        ancient temples, pagodas, and historical relics while your guide shares stories about the area&#39;s past and local traditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Cruise Through Tràng An Scenic Landscape</strong></p>
      <p>Next, head to the Tràng An Scenic Landscape Complex, where you&#39;ll board a small rowboat for a breathtaking ride through 
        towering karst formations covered in lush jungle. As you glide along the water, your guide will tell you about the prehistoric 
        communities that once lived in these mountains and the farmers who still work the land today.
        Be prepared to duck as the boat passes through low caves and grottoes. Along the way, you&#39;ll see peaceful pagodas nestled by 
        the river and even visit a filming location from Kong: Skull Island, which you can explore on foot.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>Located about 180 kilometers from Hanoi, Ha Long City is a top-tier city in Quang Ninh Province and is widely known 
        as a tourism hotspot in northern Vietnam. Its strategic location and natural beauty attract millions of visitors 
        from both within the country and abroad every year. The highlight of the region is Ha Long Bay, a breathtaking 
        natural wonder covering 1,553 square kilometers. The bay features nearly 2,000 limestone islands of various shapes 
        and sizes. Recognized multiple times by UNESCO, Ha Long Bay is considered a must-see destination for any traveler. 
        Alongside its stunning scenery, Ha Long boasts a modern transportation system and well-developed infrastructure, 
        making it an ideal place for leisure, shopping, dining, and entertainment.</p>

      </figure>

      <p><strong>Dive into the Coral Reefs</strong></p>
      <p>While most visitors focus on the bay&#39;s surface beauty, the underwater world is equally fascinating. Ha Long Bay is 
        home to over 140 coral species, including rare types. These reefs thrive around islands like Cong Do, where strict regulations 
        and natural isolation help protect marine life. Join a diving tour to observe sea creatures such as starfish, sea horses, 
        and turtles in crystal-clear waters. You can also explore underwater caves and grottos. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced 
        diver, there are options for everyone—including snorkeling trips in deeper waters.</p>

      </figure>

      <p><strong>Cruise Through the Bay</strong></p>
      <p>The best way to experience Ha Long Bay is by boat. You can choose between traditional junk boats for a slow, scenic ride or modern 
        yachts for quicker island-hopping. While half-day or full-day cruises are available, a multi-day trip offers a more immersive 
        experience.
        Spend two or three days aboard a cruise ship, enjoying meals, cocktails, and guided tours. Some cruises offer spa services, cooking classes, yoga at sunrise, and even night-time squid fishing. Sleeping on the boat and stargazing from the deck is a unique and unforgettable experience.
        Don&#39;t miss the chance to kayak around the limestone karsts. The calm waters make it safe and enjoyable to paddle through caves, 
        around floating villages, and between islands. Take a swim in the bay before returning to the boat for sunset views and dinner.</p>

      <p><strong>Explore the Caves: Sung Sot, Me Cung, and Thien Cung</strong></p>
      <p>Ha Long Bay is home to many caves, each with its own story. Among the most famous are:
        Sung Sot Cave: Known for its massive size and unusual rock formations. The cave covers 10,000 square meters and features two chambers 
        filled with stalactites and stalagmites shaped like animals and warriors. It&#39;s accessible via a steep hike, but the views are worth the effort.
        Me Cung Cave: The oldest and narrowest cave in the bay. Archaeologists have found fossils over 10,000 years old at its entrance. Inside, 
        you&#39;ll find a maze of tunnels and chambers decorated with natural rock formations.
        Thien Cung Cave: Often called the most beautiful cave. According to legend, it was the wedding venue of the Dragon King and his bride, May. 
        Today, the cave is lit with colorful lights that enhance its magical atmosphere. Sunlight streams through ceiling openings, creating a dramatic 
        effect. The exit offers a panoramic view of Ha Long Bay.</p>
